# Raspberry Pi 5 Face Detection System Requirements
# =================================================
# 
# Note: On Raspberry Pi, it's recommended to use system OpenCV (python3-opencv)
# which is installed via apt in setup.sh. This requirements.txt is for pip
# installation as a fallback or if you prefer pip-installed OpenCV.

# Core dependencies for face detection
ultralytics>=8.0.0
opencv-python>=4.8.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Raspberry Pi Camera Module support
picamera2>=0.3.12

# Note: pathlib and argparse are built-in Python modules (Python 3.4+)
# No need to install them separately

# Optional: For better performance on Raspberry Pi 5
# Uncomment if you have OpenCV with optimizations
# opencv-contrib-python>=4.8.0

# Note: These are the minimal requirements for the face detection system
# The system is optimized for Raspberry Pi 5 with limited resources
