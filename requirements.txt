# Raspberry Pi 5 Face Detection & Recognition System Requirements (Picamera2 Only)
# ================================================================================

# Core dependencies for face detection
ultralytics>=8.0.0
# Note: numpy is often installed as system package - if you have system picamera2,
# use system numpy to avoid version conflicts. Only install via pip if needed.
# numpy>=1.24.0

# Raspberry Pi Camera Module support (REQUIRED)
picamera2>=0.3.12

# Image processing and drawing (replaces OpenCV)
Pillow>=10.0.0

# Face recognition library (for facial recognition features)
# Note: This requires dlib which can take a while to build on Raspberry Pi
# Consider installing dlib system package first: sudo apt install -y libdlib-dev
face_recognition>=1.3.0

# Video processing for enrollment (lightweight)
imageio>=2.31.0
imageio-ffmpeg>=0.4.9

# Note: pathlib, argparse, and json are built-in Python modules (Python 3.4+)
# No need to install them separately

# Note: This system uses picamera2 ONLY - no OpenCV required
# The system is optimized for Raspberry Pi 5 with Raspberry Pi Camera Module
